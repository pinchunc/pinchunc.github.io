      "contents": "\n\n\n\nPin-Chun is a Marie Curie Postdoctoral Fellow working with Dr. Bernhard Staresina at the Department of Experimental Psychology at Oxford University, UK and Dr. Brett Foster at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, USA. Her work leverages multimodal neuroimaging techniques to understand the neural mechanisms of learning and memory through the lens of sleep and explore how sleep can be leveraged to combat disease and cognitive decline.\nShe earned her Ph.D. in Cognitive Sciences from the University of California, Irvine, in 2022 under the supervision of Dr. Sara Mednick. The central focus of her research is to utilize advanced neuroimaging techniques during sleep to characterize signatures of memory processing that enhance our congitive functions. A list of her peer-reviewed manuscripts and abstracts can be found on Google Scholar.\nPin-Chun was born and grew up in Kaohsiung, a city in southern Taiwan. In 2013, she moved to Taipei to pursue undergraduate studies at National Chengchi University, where she worked with Dr. Chien-Ming Yang in the Sleep Lab. In 2017, she received my B.S. in Psychology and B.Ed. in Education with 1st Class Honors. After graduation, Pin-Chun moved to the United States to work on my Ph.D. research with Dr. Sara Mednick in the Sleep and Cognition Lab at the University of California, Irvine. While pursuing her PhD, she completed a Master in Statistics from the Department of Statistics at UC Irvine in 2020.\n\n\n\n",

She also had us think on our own why the answer choice we picked was the right one so that we wouldn’t just have the answers given to us. Her strength was making the students work on their own to develop better thinking skills.”\n“Pin-Chun is a great TA. Literally the BEST TA I’ve ever had. She is extremely helpful, replies to questions through emails with no delay, and is very knowledgable about all the topics. She is awesome.”\n“Pin-Chun creates an open environment during the discussion so students feel completely comfortable asking questions and collaborating, she works very hard and is always on time with grading.”\n“She is such a nice person, and she is so helpful. Always there to answer your questions, whether in-person or by email. And visiting everyone during the lab sessions to make sure that they were all doing okay and didn’t have any questions really impressed me. I’ve never had a TA do that before.”\n“She is very welcoming and approachable, which made me unafraid to ask her for help. She is very knowledgeable about the subject matter and was very communicative and responsive, both in and outside of class. Pin Chun was willing to discuss her personal research with us, which was very interesting to hear about and valuable information in assessing my own research interests.”\n“She gave out really clear and organized instructions. I can tell that she wants everyone from the class to understand the material and do well in the class. She is a really nice person, easy to communicate and reach.
