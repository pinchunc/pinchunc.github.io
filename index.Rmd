Pin-Chun is a postdoctoral researcher in [Dr. Brett Foster's lab](https://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p9416634) at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, USA. She is co-advised by [Dr. Bernhard Staresina](https://www.psy.ox.ac.uk/people/bernhard-staresina) at the Department of Experimental Psychology at Oxford University, UK. 

She earned her Ph.D. in Cognitive Sciences from the University of California, Irvine, in 2022 under the supervision of [Dr. Sara Mednick](http://sleepandcognitionlab.org). The central focus of her research is to utilize  advanced neuroimaging techniques during sleep to characterize signatures of memory processing that enhance our congitive functions. A list of her peer-reviewed manuscripts and abstracts can be found on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zhIGL70AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).
