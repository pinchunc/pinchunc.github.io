Pin-Chun is a Marie Curie Postdoctoral Fellow working with [Dr. Bernhard Staresina](https://www.psy.ox.ac.uk/people/bernhard-staresina) at the Department of Experimental Psychology at Oxford University, UK and [Dr. Brett Foster](https://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p9416634) at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, USA. Her work leverages multimodal neuroimaging techniques to understand the neural mechanisms of learning and memory through the lens of sleep and explore how sleep can be leveraged to combat disease and cognitive decline.

She earned her Ph.D. in Cognitive Sciences from the University of California, Irvine, in 2022 under the supervision of [Dr. Sara Mednick](http://sleepandcognitionlab.org). The central focus of her research is to utilize  advanced neuroimaging techniques during sleep to characterize signatures of memory processing that enhance our congitive functions. A list of her peer-reviewed manuscripts and abstracts can be found on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zhIGL70AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).

Pin-Chun was born and grew up in Kaohsiung, a city in southern Taiwan. In 2013, she moved to Taipei to pursue undergraduate studies at National Chengchi University, where she worked with Dr. Chien-Ming Yang in the Sleep Lab. In 2017, she received my B.S. in Psychology and B.Ed. in Education with 1st Class Honors. After graduation, Pin-Chun moved to Irvine to work on my Ph.D. research with Dr. Sara Mednick in the Sleep and Cognition Lab at the University of California, Irvine. In the meanwhile, she completed a Master in Statistics from the Department of Statistics at UC Irvine in 2020.
