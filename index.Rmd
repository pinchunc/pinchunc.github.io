Hello, I’m Pin-Chun. I am a Cognitive Science Ph.D. candidate at the University of California, Irvine, preparing to graduate sometime in 2021-2022. My research interests are sleep and cognition, including the role of aging, cardiac autonomic activity, and brain stimulation on sleep-dependent cognitive enhancement.

I was born and grew up in Kaohsiung, a city in southern Taiwan. In 2013, I moved to Taipei to pursue my undergraduate studies at National Chengchi University, where I worked with Dr. Chien-Ming Yang in the Sleep Lab. In 2017, I received my B.S. in Psychology and B.Ed. in Education with 1st Class Honors. After graduation, I moved to Irvine to work on my Ph.D. research with Dr. Sara Mednick in the Sleep and Cognition Lab at the University of California, Irvine. In the meanwhile, I completed a Master in Statistics from the Department of Statistics at UC Irvine in 2020. A list of my peer-reviewed manuscripts and abstracts can be found on Google Scholar or Research Gate.

Besides research activities, I consider myself an activist for LGBTQ+ rights. I’m also a former percussionist at Taiwan Soloists Symphony Orchestra, National Taiwan Symphony Orchestra Youth Camp, and National Taiwan University Symphony Orchestra. During my free time, I enjoy hiking, traveling, snowboarding, and cooking.
