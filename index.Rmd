Pin-Chun is a postdoctoral researcher in Dr. Brett Foster's lab at Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, USA. She is currently co-advised by Dr Bernhard Staresina at Oxford University, UK. 

She earned her Ph.D. in Cognitive Sciences from the University of California, Irvine, in 2022 under the supervision of Dr. Sara Mednick. The central focus of her research is to utilize  advanced neuroimaging techniques during sleep to characterize signatures of memory processing that enhance our congitive functions.

In 2017, she received my B.S. in Psychology and B.Ed. in Education with 1st Class Honors. After graduation, Pin-Chun moved to Irvine to work on my Ph.D. research with Dr. Sara Mednick in the Sleep and Cognition Lab at the University of California, Irvine. In the meanwhile, she completed a Master in Statistics from the Department of Statistics at UC Irvine in 2020. A list of her peer-reviewed manuscripts and abstracts can be found on Google Scholar or Research Gate.
